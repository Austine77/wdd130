        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="p1">Sunday Prince Augustine, White water rafting started in the year 2019, when a small group of river enthusiasts sets out to
            share their
            passion for
            outdoors and the thrill of navigating powerful waterways. Our mission has always been more than just
            adventure- It's about
            connecting with nature, fostering community and protecting the rivers we cherish. We are designed to provide
            you with information
            and resources for rafting trips, kayaking lessons, stand-up paddleboarding and multi-day river expeditions.
            We offer high safety
            measures, required gear and preparation tips for participants. Whether you're a seasoned paddler or a
            first-time adventurer, we
            invite you to become part of our story. Together let's ride the rapids, embrace the wild, and create
            memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
